# Domain model & invariants

The durable source of truth for *what the numbers mean* and *what the data guarantees are*.
Formulas here describe how **we** compute things — they are deliberately simple and transparent,
not proprietary. When the code and this doc disagree, fix one of them; don't let them drift.

Implementation lives in `src/lib/server/services/analytics/` (load + analytics page) and
`src/lib/server/services/dashboardService.ts` (the cockpit dashboard).

## Training load (TSS)

Per-activity load is "best available TSS", chosen in priority order (`analytics/load.ts`,
`loadFor`):

1. **Stored `loadScore`** if present and > 0 (e.g. Garmin-precomputed training load).
2. **IF-based TSS** when we can compute an intensity factor: `hours × IF² × 100`.
3. **Sport-factor fallback** from duration alone: `hours × sportFactor × 100`.

where `hours = durationSec / 3600`.

**Intensity factor (IF)** (`intensityFactorFor`):
- **Bike** → `power / FTP` (normalized-power-like value if available, else average power).
- **Run** → `avgHr / thresholdHr`.
- **Swim / Strength / Other** → no IF (falls through to the sport-factor fallback).

**Sport factors** (used by the fallback):

| Sport | factor |
|---|---:|
| Bike | 0.60 |
| Run | 0.70 |
| Swim | 0.65 |
| Strength | 0.50 |
| Other | 0.50 |

**Thresholds** are per-user (`ftpWatts`, `thresholdHrBpm`); when unset, defaults are
**FTP = 240 W** and **threshold HR = 160 bpm**.

## Performance Management Chart: Fitness / Fatigue / Form

`daily_load` = sum of per-activity load on that local calendar day. From the daily series we
derive three values. **Two surfaces compute them two different ways — this is intentional and
worth knowing:**

- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`, the cockpit)** uses an **EWMA** over an 84-day window, seeded at 0:
  ```text
  aC = 1 − e^(−1/42)      aA = 1 − e^(−1/7)
  CTL (Fitness) += (daily_load − CTL) × aC     # 42-day time constant
  ATL (Fatigue) += (daily_load − ATL) × aA     # 7-day  time constant
  TSB (Form)     = CTL − ATL
  ```
- **Analytics page (`/analytics`, `/api/analytics`)** uses **simple trailing rolling averages**:
  `Fitness = mean(daily_load, 42d)`, `Fatigue = mean(daily_load, 7d)`,
  `Freshness = Fitness − Fatigue`.

(The EWMA is the more responsive "today" reading; the rolling average is the smoother historical
series. Don't assume a single global formula.)

### Derived dashboard signals (with the exact bands)

The dashboard's KPI bands are **coaching heuristics, tunable in `buildKpiIndicators`** — not hard
science. Current thresholds:

- **Ramp** = ΔCTL over the last 7 days. Fitness status: `≥8 Spiking`, `≥3 Building`,
  `>−2 Steady`, `>−6 Easing`, else `Detraining`.
- **Fatigue** status from the `ATL/CTL` ratio: `<0.7 Low`, `≤1.1 Normal`, `≤1.4 High`,
  else `Very high`.
- **Form (TSB)** status: `>20 Peaked`, `≥8 Fresh`, `≥−10 Balanced`, `≥−25 Fatigued`,
  else `Overreached` (marker scaled on a −30…+30 track).
- **Week TSS** = Σ daily load over the last 7 days, judged against a sustainable load ≈ `CTL × 7`.
- **Monotony** = `mean / sd` of the last 7 daily loads; **Strain** = `Σload₇ × monotony`.
- **Readiness** = `clamp(round(50 + TSB × 1.6), 3, 100)`, labelled `≥78 Race-ready`,
  `≥60 Fresh`, `≥42 Productive`, `≥26 Fatigued`, else `Overreached`. (Note: this readiness label
  is a *separate* scale from the Form/TSB bands above — don't conflate the two.)

## Weekly aggregation & compliance

- **Weeks start Monday** (`weekStartIsoMonday`).
- **Weekly totals**: sums of `durationSec`, `distanceM`, `elevationGainM`, and load over the week
  (missing values count as 0).
- **Compliance** is computed only for **linked** planned↔completed pairs (`workout_links`):
  ```text
  duration_compliance = completed_duration / planned_duration   (etc. for distance, load)
  ```
  Weekly compliance aggregates by totals, not by averaging ratios:
  `Σ(completed) / Σ(planned)`. If the planned total is 0 or missing, compliance shows as `—`.

## Deduplication guarantees (3 layers)

Across all three ingestion paths (upload, live sync, bulk import), an activity is deduped by, in
order of cost:

1. **Garmin activity id** (`sourceActivityId`) — cheapest; skips before downloading.
2. **FIT bytes SHA-256** (`sourceFileSha256` / `activity_files.sha256`) — exact content match
   across sync, upload, and export. Re-importing the same export is a no-op.
3. **Fingerprint** — `sport + startTime + duration + distance`, applied after parse as a final
   guard against the same activity arriving via different files.

## Data-model invariants

- `activities.source` ∈ `{ garmin-sync, garmin-export, upload }` — provenance is never lost.
- `parserVersion` is stored per activity so re-parsing/backfills are detectable.
- **Sync cursor** = `garmin_credentials.lastSyncAt` (epoch ms of the newest imported activity);
  the live sync only pulls activities newer than this.
- **`sync_jobs`** is the single durable record of per-user sync state: lock (owner + timestamp),
  throttle, consecutive-failure count, and circuit-breaker cooldown. One row per user.
- **Streams** are stored at `data/streams/<activityId>.json.gz`; `activities.streamPath` holds the
  relative path. Streams are bounded at parse time (record cap) to keep blobs sane.
- Bulk imports record **per-file** outcomes in `import_items` (discovered/imported/duplicate/
  unsupported/failed) under an `import_batches` row; one bad file never aborts the batch.

## Glossary

- **CTL / Fitness** — chronic training load; long-term (42d) load trend.
- **ATL / Fatigue** — acute training load; short-term (7d) load.
- **TSB / Form / Freshness** — training stress balance, `CTL − ATL`.
- **TSS / Load** — training stress score; our per-activity load number.
- **IF** — intensity factor (effort relative to threshold).
- **Ramp** — rate of CTL change (build rate).
- **Monotony / Strain** — Foster's training-monotony and -strain measures.
- **CSS / Critical Speed** — swim/run threshold-pace analogues (planned; see ROADMAP).
